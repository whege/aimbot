## What is it?
AIMBoT:  **A**rtificially **I**ntelligent **M**oderator **Bo**t for **Twitch**

## Why?
Moderation is hard. Some links are ok, others aren't. Most bots do a bad job at telling the difference
and take a hard-line stance. The goal is to create a bot that can leverage Machine
Learning to detect and take action on spam or otherwise unwanted messages.
